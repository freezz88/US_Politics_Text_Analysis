Thank you for reading this instruction.

The repository consists of three important files. The .ipynb notebook file as a modern variant, which allows the execution of the code part by part. As another positive aspect it can divide the code segments in the different phases of NLP and the standard process of CRISP-DM. To open and execute .ipynb files you can use locally installed software on your computer or web tools.

The .py file is a classical programming representation and is useful for a fast execution in one step. For example you can easily execute the .py file in a prompt. Please use new versions of Python to avoid errors and security vulnerabilities.

The third file is the .csv data, that will be used automatically by executing the code. For a manually analysis and for evaluating the NLP results, you can open and read it. You should filter the first column for "comments", if you want to see the interesting data for analysis.

Important notice for usage: Please execute the code segments in the specific order. NLP has different phases and the order is very important for good results.
Notice for execution times: Text Preprocessing and calculation coherence scores takes a lot of time. This isn't an error.
